# How-to-learn-Pandas-quickly
This project shows the important Pandas elements and a learning approach that will allow one to quickly start using Pandas with confidence.

This is for people who knows some Python and want to use the package Pandas for processing data.
After reading the material, you will have a big picture of the key elements of Pandas. 
Then by following the learning approach, you will remember the key elements hopefully in 3 days and start to use Pandas with ease.


# The approach:
In order to learn Pandas quickly, please repeat those key elements by coding or writing on a paper every day for three days or more.
When you just start to get familiar with Pandas, it might be more effective if you make this the first thing to do in the morning and try to spend 20 or 30 minutes. After several days, probably you will start to enjoy using Pandas.

# Pandas Features:
Pandas is derived from panel data. Pandas is built on the package numpy and allows fast calculations for matrix-like data.
The structure of the contents allows you to systematically understand the various key operations of Pandas that include: select, change, add, delete, merge, aggregate. Make sure you know how to do each of them. If you are familiar with SQL, the operations are similar.
